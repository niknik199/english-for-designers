# Student and freelance graphic designer with a passion for branding and typography.

I am currently in my final year of a Bachelor’s degree in Graphic Design at PSCC, alongside working as a freelance graphic designer for over a year. Throughout this time, I have engaged in various projects. For example including a long-term collaboration with Pets Yoga Prague, for which I developed their branding and additional visual materials. 

Additionally, I hold a position of a graphic designer at Mantaa agency, where I create both online and print promotional content for the cosmetic brand Kneipp and Hartmann. This agency collaborates with clients such as Notino, DM, Rossmann, Alza, ElNino etc., so my work usually appears on their websites or magazines.  

Balancing my studies, work, and upcoming motherhood in just a few months has proven to be really challenging. I aspire to continue growing in the design field while balancing my upcoming journey into motherhood.

# Nikola's journey to graphic design

From an early age, I've had a strong visual thinking and a deep passion for painting, crafting, and all creative things. I attended various art courses and exhibitions, which fueled my artistic interests. Although I applied to study graphic design at high school, but this wasn’t the right time for me. I was not accepted. Instead, I pursued my studies at a gymnasium, which I absolutely loved. I enjoyed the subject diversity, which broadened my horizons, but still cultivated my passion for culture through regular visits of art exhibitions, seminars, and theater performances.

Disappointed by my first failure in graphic design, I decided to explore architecture as my next path at the university, thinking it would allow me to express my creativity enough. So I spent three years studying architecture at the Czech Technical University, but then faced burnout. Of course, architecture is a creative field, but it also comes with very strict regulations regarding safety and economic factors, which was very difficult for me to have such strong boulndaries. I found it increasingly challenging to express myself freely in this environment. So, just before completing my bachelor’s thesis, I realised that this was not the right path for me. I chose to go back to graphic design, a field that provides me more freedom, creative expression, and artistic fulfillment I had been seeking all along.
