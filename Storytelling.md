# When Design Fails, Stress Grows
Storytelling: Why Simplicity and Clarity in Graphic Design Matter More Than Ever

## Who I Am (And How I Got Here)

Hi, I’m Nikola Zemanová – I'm a graphic designer, big thinker, and I'm obsessed with beauty, meaning and thoughtful design.

. 

Ever since I was little, I’ve loved making things. Drawing, painting, inventing, reimagining – I didn't like to follow the instructions. I liked doing things my way. My parents and grandparents always supported my creativity, and my dad was convinced I’d become an architect.

.

And I tried! I spent three years studying architecture… but in the end, it didn’t feel right. The further I went, the more I realized: the technical part was swallowing my creativity. It was too rigid. I didn’t want to calculate — I wanted to create. So I walked away.

.

After I left the architecture, I started experimenting.
And suddenly, I felt much more free. I started selling my paintings, then tried to sell handmade crocheted home decor. Made my own clothes. And just tried to let the ideas breathe again. After that, I found myself truly passionate for the graphics, so I went to PCSS and slowly started working as a freelance designer.

.

One of my first out-of-school projects was a Japanese cultural event branding and promotion. My partner made calligraphy for the exhibition which was a part of the event and I did graphics. He is a programmer, so we also did a brand new website for them together. And after few other school projects, I got contacted by the owner of Pets Yoga Prague company. They were looking for a new brand identity. This was my first "real big project" and I loved it. 


My main focus went to graphics. And meanwhile, in some free time, I was baking cakes, made some good-looking foods, dabbled in ceramics, visited galleries and sketched elven women.

One thing always stayed the same:
I was chasing creativity and beauty. Whatever the medium, that was always my drive.

.

And than suddenly, life gave me a whole new brief.

.

Becoming a mom.

.

Nothing has shifted my perspective more. I had to learn, how to slow down a little bit. In those early days, everything changed. 
And suddenly, design wasn’t just about beautiful compositions or smart layouts. It became about clarity, function and peace.
I realized that bad design isn’t just annoying. It’s exhausting and it can even cause a harm. 

.

I'd like to share with you 3 stories I experienced recently, which made me think about it more.


- **Lost in the Hospital Maze**

i had a C-section and after my birth, my partner — usually very organized person — found himself spending a lot more time than expected moving between departments. He was trying to arrange a better room for me in the postpartum ward, visiting our daughter in the neonatal ICU while I was still in adult ICU, and taking care of paperwork.
The hospital's poor signage and confusing layout made everything much more difficult and stressful at a time when things were already overwhelming.


- **The Formula Milk Crisis**

when we got home, I had some troubles with milk, so I had to prepare formula milk for my baby. 
The instructions on the box were very small, confusing, and badly organized.
Under stress, with a baby crying in my arms, I miscounted the scoops — and had to start again.
(Getting the amount wrong can be really dangerous for newborns.)

- **Misleading Product Photos**

The last straw was, when I wanted to order groceries online in a rush and deep sleep deprivation, I quickly added what I thought was a pack of bottled water based on the product image.
When the order arrived, it turned out to be just one bottle.
The misleading product photo, combined with my exhaustion, caused frustration, unnecessary reorders, and wasted time — something new parents can’t afford...

### **A little UX Win!**

Not everything was a struggle.
One small but brilliant design really made our day:
When dressing our daughter in her new onesie, my partner came running, excitedly shouting, "These pajamas have an amazing UX design!"
The onesie had a special snap button colored differently to show the correct fastening direction.
If you tried to close it wrong, it simply wouldn't fit.
Such a tiny, thoughtful detail made dressing a newborn so much easier and faster.
It’s small UX wins like this that can truly make a difference in everyday life.

## What I Learned

In all these moments, I didn’t need more information.

I needed **better design**.

Design that understood what I was going through: tired, emotional, overwhelmed.  
Design that was simple, clear, and supportive.

I knew it before, that this aspect of design is important, but now I truly understood:  
**Good graphic design isn’t just about “nice visuals.”**  
**Good design is about helping people when they need it the most.**

## It’s Not Only About Mothers

Simplicity and clarity in design help everyone:

- People who are exhausted after a long day and just want things to be easy.
- Elderly people who might struggle with concentration or vision.
- Professionals managing many tasks at once.
- People with cognitive challenges, like ADHD, dyslexia or other.
- Anyone dealing with stress, needing quick, decisive answers.

They are all around us.

Clear design saves time, energy, and sometimes even health.

That’s why today, I see simplicity, clarity, and direct communication as essential values in every piece of graphic design.
It’s not just about making things look nice. It’s about making life easier.

Stress, tiredness, and fear happen to everyone.  
**Clear design can help in all these moments.**

## How I Want to Design

Now, when I will make a new designs, I will be thinking differently:

- **Be kind. Make it simple.**
- **Respect people’s time and energy.**
- **Simplify. And then simplify again.**

Simple doesn’t mean boring.  
Simple means *strong* useful and lasting.

When we make graphic design clear and easy, we don’t just make things look good.  
**We make life a little easier.**
