# When Design Fails, Stress Grows

## A Story About Simplicity, Survival, and a Crying Baby

Becoming a mom has been the most beautiful experience of my life, but it’s also been one of the hardest.  
In those early days, everything changed. Not only my body, but also my priorities, my time and my energy.  
Sleep became a luxury, emotions ran high, and time... well, it didn’t belong to me anymore.

In all the chaos, I discovered something crucial:  
**Clear and simple design can save your energy (and your nerves).**

It’s not just a “nice to have”, it’s a real need.

Here are three real moments from my life, that I experienced recently, when bad design made things harder:

- **Lost in the Hospital Maze**

After my birth, my partner — usually very organized person — found himself spending a lot more time than expected moving between departments. He was trying to arrange a better room for me in the postpartum ward, visiting our daughter in the neonatal ICU while I was still in adult ICU, and taking care of paperwork.
The hospital's poor signage and confusing layout made everything much more difficult and stressful at a time when things were already overwhelming.

- **Misleading Product Photos**

One day, while ordering groceries online in a rush and deep sleep deprivation, I quickly added what I thought was a pack of bottled water based on the product image.
When the order arrived, it turned out to be just one bottle.
The misleading product photo, combined with my exhaustion, caused frustration, unnecessary reorders, and wasted time — something new parents can’t afford...

Clear and correct visuals are essential for making fast, safe decisions.

- **The Formula Milk Crisis**

When I had to prepare formula milk for my baby.
The instructions on the box were very small, confusing, and badly organized.
Under stress, with a baby crying in my arms, I miscounted the scoops — and had to start again.
(Getting the amount wrong can be really dangerous for newborns.)

## What I Learned

In all these moments, I didn’t need more information.

I needed **better design**.

Design that understood what I was going through: tired, emotional, overwhelmed.  
Design that was simple, clear, and supportive.

I understood something very important:  
**Good graphic design isn’t just about “nice visuals.”**  
**Good design is about helping people when they need it most.**

### **A little UX Win!**

Not everything was a struggle.
One small but brilliant design really made our day:
When dressing our daughter in her new onesie, my partner came running, excitedly shouting, "These pajamas have amazing UX design!"
The onesie had a special snap button colored differently to show the correct fastening direction.
If you tried to close it wrong, it simply wouldn't fit.
Such a tiny, thoughtful design detail made dressing a squirming newborn so much easier and faster.
It’s small UX wins like this that can truly make a difference in everyday life.

## It’s Not Only About Mothers

These experiences opened my eyes.
I realized that clear and simple graphic design is not just "nice to have" — it’s a necessity.

And not just for new moms!

Simplicity and clarity in design help everyone:

- People who are exhausted after a long day and just want things to be easy.
- Elderly people who might struggle with concentration or vision.
- Anyone dealing with stress, needing quick, decisive answers.
- Professionals managing many tasks at once.
- People with cognitive challenges, like ADHD or dyslexia.

Clear design saves time, energy, and sometimes even health.

That’s why today, I see simplicity, clarity, and direct communication as essential values in every piece of graphic design.
It’s not just about making things look nice.
It’s about making life easier.

Stress, tiredness, and fear happen to everyone.  
**Clear design can help in all these moments.**

## How I Want to Design

Now, when I will make a new designs, I will be thinking differently:

- **Be kind. Make it simple.**
- **Respect people’s time and energy.**
- **Simplify. And then simplify again.**

Simple doesn’t mean boring.  
Simple means *strong* useful and lasting.

When we make graphic design clear and easy, we don’t just make things look good.  
**We make life a little easier.**
