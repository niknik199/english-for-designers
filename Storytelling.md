# When Design Fails, Stress Grows
Storytelling: Why Simplicity and Clarity in Graphic Design Matter More Than Ever

Who I Am (And How I Got Here)

Hi, I’m Nikola Zemanová – graphic designer, visual storyteller, and proud believer that good design makes life easier, not harder.

Ever since I was little, I’ve loved making things. Drawing, painting, inventing, reimagining – I rarely followed the instructions. I liked doing things my way. My parents and grandparents always supported my creativity, and my dad was convinced I’d become an architect.
And I tried! I spent three years studying architecture… but in the end, it didn’t feel right. The further I went, the more I realized: the technical part was swallowing my imagination. It was too rigid. I didn’t want to calculate — I wanted to create. So I shifted paths

So I left the architecture studies and begun my journey as a graphic designer. I started to study at PSCC. Moved in with my partner. I started experimenting.
And suddenly, I felt much more free. I started selling my paintings, then came handmade crocheted home decor. After that, I found myself truly passionate for the graphics, so I slowly started working as a freelance designer. One of my first out-of-school projects was a Japanese cultural event branding and promotion. My partner made calligraphy for the exhibition which was a part of the event and I did graphicsfor the whole event. He is a programmer, so we also did a brand new website for them together. After some other school projects, I got contacted by the owner of Pets Yoga Prague company. They were looking for a new brand identity. This was my first "real big project" and I loved it. My main focus went to graphics. And meanwhile, in some free time, I was baking cakes, made food look beautiful, dabbled in ceramics, visited galleries and sketched elven women.

One thing always stayed the same:
I was chasing creativity and beauty. Whatever the medium, that was always my drive.

And than suddenly, life gave me a whole new brief —
pregnancy and childbirth.
Nothing has shifted my perspective more. I had to learn, how to slow down a little bit.

Suddenly, design wasn’t just about beautiful compositions or smart layouts.
It became about clarity, function, peace.
I realized that bad design isn’t just annoying. It’s exhausting. It can even cause a harm. 

## A Story About Simplicity, Survival, and a Crying Baby

Becoming a mom has been the most beautiful experience of my life, but it’s also been one of the hardest.  
In those early days, everything changed. Not only my body, but also my priorities, my time and my energy.  
Sleep became a luxury, emotions ran high, and time... well, it didn’t belong to me anymore.

In all the chaos, I discovered something crucial:  
**Clear and simple design can save your energy (and your nerves).**

It’s not just a “nice to have”, it’s a real need.

Here are three real moments from my life, that I experienced recently, when bad design made things harder:

- **Lost in the Hospital Maze**

After my birth, my partner — usually very organized person — found himself spending a lot more time than expected moving between departments. He was trying to arrange a better room for me in the postpartum ward, visiting our daughter in the neonatal ICU while I was still in adult ICU, and taking care of paperwork.
The hospital's poor signage and confusing layout made everything much more difficult and stressful at a time when things were already overwhelming.

- **Misleading Product Photos**

One day, while ordering groceries online in a rush and deep sleep deprivation, I quickly added what I thought was a pack of bottled water based on the product image.
When the order arrived, it turned out to be just one bottle.
The misleading product photo, combined with my exhaustion, caused frustration, unnecessary reorders, and wasted time — something new parents can’t afford...

Clear and correct visuals are essential for making fast, safe decisions.

- **The Formula Milk Crisis**

When I had to prepare formula milk for my baby.
The instructions on the box were very small, confusing, and badly organized.
Under stress, with a baby crying in my arms, I miscounted the scoops — and had to start again.
(Getting the amount wrong can be really dangerous for newborns.)

## What I Learned

In all these moments, I didn’t need more information.

I needed **better design**.

Design that understood what I was going through: tired, emotional, overwhelmed.  
Design that was simple, clear, and supportive.

I understood something very important:  
**Good graphic design isn’t just about “nice visuals.”**  
**Good design is about helping people when they need it most.**

### **A little UX Win!**

Not everything was a struggle.
One small but brilliant design really made our day:
When dressing our daughter in her new onesie, my partner came running, excitedly shouting, "These pajamas have amazing UX design!"
The onesie had a special snap button colored differently to show the correct fastening direction.
If you tried to close it wrong, it simply wouldn't fit.
Such a tiny, thoughtful design detail made dressing a squirming newborn so much easier and faster.
It’s small UX wins like this that can truly make a difference in everyday life.

## It’s Not Only About Mothers

These experiences opened my eyes.
I realized that clear and simple graphic design is not just "nice to have" — it’s a necessity.

And not just for new moms!

Simplicity and clarity in design help everyone:

- People who are exhausted after a long day and just want things to be easy.
- Elderly people who might struggle with concentration or vision.
- Anyone dealing with stress, needing quick, decisive answers.
- Professionals managing many tasks at once.
- People with cognitive challenges, like ADHD or dyslexia.

Clear design saves time, energy, and sometimes even health.

That’s why today, I see simplicity, clarity, and direct communication as essential values in every piece of graphic design.
It’s not just about making things look nice.
It’s about making life easier.

Stress, tiredness, and fear happen to everyone.  
**Clear design can help in all these moments.**

## How I Want to Design

Now, when I will make a new designs, I will be thinking differently:

- **Be kind. Make it simple.**
- **Respect people’s time and energy.**
- **Simplify. And then simplify again.**

Simple doesn’t mean boring.  
Simple means *strong* useful and lasting.

When we make graphic design clear and easy, we don’t just make things look good.  
**We make life a little easier.**
