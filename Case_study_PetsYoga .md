# Pets Yoga Prague

PETS Yoga Prague offers something truly unique — yoga sessions with puppies. It’s calming, fun and cute. But their original visual identity didn’t reflect that at all. It felt flat and generic, and it didn’t help them stand out.
They needed a brand that would feel professional and trustworthy, but also playful, warm and easy to connect with — just like the experience itself.

I created a full rebranding concept that keeps things simple, memorable and emotionally engaging. My goal was to find a perfect balance between *professionalism* and *cuteness*, without going into anything too childish.
So I started with simmilar brands research. I needed to do it differently, to make them stand out.

## Market analysis

/ Czech market analysis /

/ European market analysis /

| Overcomplicated design      | Too much emmphasis on cuteness | The paw symbol overuse     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| difficult for the customer to remember      | logos can appear cheap, unworthy       | symbol becomes ineffective   |
|    | brand becomes less trustworthy        |       |

## Design process

The goal based on the market research and client's requremets was to create:

- **differentation from the competition**
- **proffesional look**
- **simple and memorable design**
- **emotional feel** 

So I started sketching and brainstorming my ideas on the paper, trying to find the ideal combination.
I knew I wanted to in cocporate somehow thy symbol of the dog's head or nose, ears. Anything related to dogs, but not the paw.

During the process, I started to be a little frustrated, so I also tried to work with the paw symbol, even if I knew, this symbol is so overused... nothing seemd to work out. I was struggling with too complicated designs, bad readability or poor proffesional look.
But then the idea started to form itself on the paper.

## New logo was born

The logo is based on a friendly geometric font with a playful twist — the “Y” turns into a puppy nose and smile, suggesting pet symbol and joy, but also meditating figure sitting in lotus position. 
Along with that, I developed:

- A soft, earthy, calming color palette inspired by nature
- Bold but friendly typography (Nunito Sans)
- Custom brand elements and patterns
- Business cards, posters, rollups, metro banners

Everything was designed to feel calm, friendly and full of positive energy — just like the sessions themselves.
