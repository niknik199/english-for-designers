# By playing together we can handle any emotion | **NAMOUDUŠI**

Namouduši (Namoudushi) is an educational **board game** for children aged between **6 and 12** years that teaches them how to talk about their feelings.

Have you ever seen a child overwhelmed by emotions they can’t name? I believe emotions shouldn’t be scary or shameful — not for kids, not for adults.

**Namouduši** is a board game I created as part of my bachelor’s thesis. It helps children (aged from 6 to 12 years) to explore, express, and understand emotions — through play. Because play is how kids learn the best.

It is not just a "typical board game". It is a tool for deeper **emotional understanding** and strenghtening the relationship between children and their parents.

My wish is to create a safe space without judging, where everyone can be heard and accepted for who they really are.
It is really important for children to learn this ability, not just for the parent-children relationship, but it provides lifelong skills that can influence much more, than we think.

## The problem: Hiding emotions

Emotional intelligence is rarely taught, but it shapes everything: our relationships, problem solving skills, and feeling about ourselves.

Many children, and even adults don’t know how to talk about their emotions. Parents often don’t know how to help their kids, because they didn't learn to talk about it too. They've been taught to hide and supress the emotions so they expect the same from their children... But children can't.

So my goal was simple - create a tool that makes emotions easier to talk about. Not through lectures, but through stories, fun activiities. laughter, and connection. Through spending some *quality time* together.
