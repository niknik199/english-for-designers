# By playing together we can handle any emotion | **NAMOUDUŠI**

Namouduši (Namoudushi) is an educational **board game** for children aged between **6 and 12** years that teaches them how to talk about their feelings.

Have you ever seen a child overwhelmed by emotions they can’t name? I believe emotions shouldn’t be scary or shameful — not for kids, not for adults.

**Namouduši** is a board game I created as part of my bachelor’s thesis. It helps children (aged from 6 to 12 years) to explore, express, and understand emotions — through play. Because play is how kids learn the best.

It is not just a "typical board game". It is a tool for deeper **emotional understanding** and strenghtening the relationship between children and their parents.

My wish is to create a safe space without judging, where everyone can be heard and accepted for who they really are.
It is really important for children to learn this ability, not just for the parent-children relationship, but it provides lifelong skills that can influence much more, than we think.

## **The problem: Hiding emotions**

Emotional intelligence is rarely taught, but it shapes everything: our relationships, problem solving skills, and feeling about ourselves.

Many children, and even adults don’t know how to talk about their emotions. Parents often don’t know how to help their kids, because they didn't learn to talk about it too. They've been taught to hide and supress the emotions so they expect the same from their children... But children can't.

So my goal was simple - create a tool that makes emotions easier to talk about. Not through lectures, but through stories, fun activiities. laughter, and connection. Through spending some *quality time* together. 

## **The Solution: Welcome to the world full of emotions! It's all already in you, let's just explore it together!**

The game introduces a group of emotional creatures — each one represents one of 8 feelings. There is joy, sadness, fear, anger, trust, disgust, anticipation and surprise. Kids meet these characters in different activities, which help them figure out what’s going on. 

**Why do you think people have trust issues? What can you hear, if we stay quiet for a while? Do you think it is okay to cry, if we are sad?**

Through the interaction, children learn to:
- Name and recognize different emotions,
- Understand why feelings happen,
- Talk about their own emotions,
- Support others with empathy.

**The game includes:**
- Emotion playing cards
- A colorful board with 8 emotion zones
- 3D characters,

### **There are no winners or losers. The goal is shared understanding.**

The game is designed to be flexible: families can play together, techers can use it in class, therapists can bring it into their sessions. No two games are the same, every round opens up new conversations.

## The biggest challenge when designing Namouduši was to find the right target group. 
Firstly the concept was meant to be for younger children, but after several consultation with the psychologists, I decided that this particular version of the game would be more suitable for older children. There is an opportunity, and I hope, I will take it, to make more versions of the game for other age cathegories.

## The result is a design that feels safe
Visuals were a key part of the experience. I worked with soft, rounded shapes, colorful, yet calming palettes, and child-friendly typography.

Each emotion has its own color and character — based on psychological research how people perceive shapes and colors. The aim was to make every element feel warm, inviting, and emotionally safe.
As I said, I see Namouduši Junior (for children 6 to 12 years old) as a starting point.I'd like to create more versions, that would adapt to different age groups. I believe, there is much more potential.

Namouduši isn’t just a game — it’s a bridge between children and adults. And maybe, that’s where real learning begins
