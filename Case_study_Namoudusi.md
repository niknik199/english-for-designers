## **Namouduši**
Namouduši (Namoudushi) is an educational board game for children aged between 6 and 12 years.
I created this project as part of my bachelor thesis.
It creates a safe space where children can learn how to identify, name, express and safely process their emotions. 
It is not just a "typical board game". It is a tool for deeper emotional understanding and strenghtening the relationship between children and their parents. 

My wish is to create a safe space without judging, where everyone can be heard and accepted for who they really are.
It is really important for children to learn this ability, not just for the parent-children relationship, but it provides lifelong skills that can influence much more, than we think.
