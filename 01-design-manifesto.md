## My key values as a designer

### 1. Passion for what you are doing 🔥
Passion for the things you are doing is important for everyone. Not just designers. As Steve Jobs said, "The only way to do great work is to love what you do.”, and it is doubly true for pleople working in creative industry. Unless you became truly passionate about the assignment, you won't get inspired and the results won't be the best. Without the passion design loses its meaning.

### 2. Freedom 🗽
Personally the main thing I adore about the design is the freedom. I have always been a creative person with a visual thinking. But when I was choosing the university, firstly I chose to study architecture at CTU. 

Some people might say, that architecture is very creative, and it definitely can be, but it has VERY STRICT rules, which are important for the safety, ecology, comfort, financial costs, etc. It is a huge responsibility, and it is very hard to keep being creative, while design good buildings for people at the same time.

Graphic design allows me to be much more free, creative and let my imagination run wildly with almoost no boundaries.

### 3. Purpose 🎯
Every design must have meaning, purpose and be functional. It is not just about the aesthetic. The visual is VERY important. It is one of the main things, that sales the products. But it ALWAYS has to have purpose and function. I feel really satisfied when I'm looking at some good design and find some little details, that makes the design more meaningful, interesting and memorable. Isn't it nice, when you find some kind of "easter egg" in a design you have seen many times, but never explored it in detail before?

### 4. Growth 🚀
What is really important for designers, is to be always willing to evolve. Keeping up with new trends, technologies. Being open to change. The world around us keeps changing every day, so we have to keep up with it.
