# Design manifesto

## My key values as a designer

### 1. Passion for what you are doing
I have to love the topic and find the passion for every specific task to deliver the best results. Without passion, design loses its meaning.

### 2. Freedom
For me design is about exploring new ideas, experimenting, and pushing boundaries without restrictions.

### 3. Purpose
Every design must have meaning, purpose and be functional.

### 4. Growth
Always want to keep evolving. Keeping up with new trends, technologies. Being open to change.
